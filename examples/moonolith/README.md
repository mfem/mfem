This directory contains modifications of the example codes that illustrate the
use of MFEM features based on ParMoonolith library for variational information
transfer between non-matching meshes.

To build these examples, make sure that MFEM is configured with the option
"MFEM_USE_MOONOLITH = YES".

For the parallel version add also the options MFEM_USE_MPI = YES", and
MFEM_USE_METIS = YES". See the top-level INSTALL file for details.
