This directory contains modifications of the example codes that illustrate the
use of MFEM features based on the EPIC suite of time integration.

To build these examples, make sure that MFEM is configured with the option
"MFEM_USE_EPIC = YES".

We recommend comparing the original example codes with the corresponding files
in the current directory.
