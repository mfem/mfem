This directory contains modifications of the example codes that illustrate the
use of MFEM features based on the Ginkgo high-performance linear algebra library
for GPU and manycore nodes.

To build these examples, make sure that MFEM is configured with the option
"MFEM_USE_GINKGO = YES", see the top-level INSTALL file for details.

We recommend comparing the original example codes with the corresponding files
in the current directory.
