# Dumps log of PETSc code
# For 3D runs with large number of local elements you'll notice
# that TSJacobianEval will take a large portion of the computation
# this is because in this example we are providing both RHS and
# I jacobians, and PETSc has to sum them up when using fully
# implicit methods
