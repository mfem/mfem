This directory contains modifications of the example codes that illustrate the
use of MFEM features based on the SUNDIALS suite of time integration and
non-linear solvers.

To build these examples, make sure that MFEM is configured with the option
"MFEM_USE_SUNDIALS = YES", see the top-level INSTALL file for details.

We recommend comparing the original example codes with the corresponding files
in the current directory.

See also the SUNDIALS-based CVODES miniapps in ../../miniapps/adjoint.
