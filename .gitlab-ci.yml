# General GitLab pipelines configurations for supercomputers and Linux clusters
# at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). This entire pipeline is
# LLNL-specific!


# The pipeline is divided into stages. Usually, jobs in a given stage wait for
# the preceding stages to complete before to start. However, we sometimes use
# the "needs" keyword and express the DAG of jobs for more efficiency.
# - We use setup and setup_baseline phases to download content outside of mfem
#   directory.
# - Allocate/Release is where quartz resource are allocated/released once for all.
# - Build and Test is where we build and MFEM for multiple toolchains.
# - Baseline_checks gathers baseline-type test suites execution
# - Baseline_publish, only available on master, allows to update baseline
#   results
stages:
  - sub-pipelines
