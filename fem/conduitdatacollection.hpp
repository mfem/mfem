/** @brief Data collection that uses the Conduit Mesh Blueprint
    specification. */
/** ConduitDataCollection provides json, simple binary, and HDF5-based file
    formats for visualization or restart. It also provides methods that convert
    between MFEM Meshes and GridFunctions and Conduit Mesh Blueprint
    descriptions.

    For more information, see:
    - LLNL conduit project, https://github.com/LLNL/conduit
    - HDF5 library, https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5

    @note The ConduitDataCollection only wraps the mfem objects to save them and
    creates them on load, Conduit does not own any of the data. The
    SidreDataCollection provides more features, for example the
    SidreDataCollection allocates and will own the data backing the mfem objects
    in the data collection.

    This class also provides public static methods that convert between MFEM
    Meshes and GridFunctions and Conduit Mesh Blueprint descriptions.

    Those that describe MFEM data using Conduit (MFEM to Conduit Blueprint) try
    to zero-copy as much of data MFEM as possible. The Conduit node result will
    not own all of the data, however you can easily make a copy of the result
    node using Conduit's API when necessary.

    Those that construct MFEM objects from Conduit Nodes (Conduit Blueprint to
    MFEM) provide a zero-copy option. Zero-copy is only possible if the
    blueprint data matches the data types provided by the MFEM API, for example:
    ints for connectivity arrays, doubles for field value arrays, allocations
    that match MFEM's striding options, etc. If these constraints are not met,
    MFEM objects that own the data are created and returned. In either case
    pointers to new MFEM object instances are returned, the zero-copy only
    applies to data backing the MFEM object instances.

    @note QuadratureFunction%s (q-fields) are not supported.

    @note AMR Meshes are not fully supported.

    @warning This class is still _experimental_, meaning that in future
    releases, it may not be backward compatible, and the output files generated
    by the current version may become unreadable.
