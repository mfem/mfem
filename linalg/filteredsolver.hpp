/**
* @class FilteredSolver
* @brief Base class for solvers with filtering (subspace correction).
*
* FilteredSolver is designed to augment an existing solver with an additional
* filtering step that targets small subspaces where the solver is less
* effective. The filtered subspace is defined by a transfer operator @p P,
* which maps the subspace into the full space.
*
* ## Typical usage
* 1. Call SetOperator() to define the system operator.
* 2. Call SetSolver() to provide the underlying solver.
* 3. Call SetFilteredSubspaceTransferOperator() to define the subspace mapping.
* 4. Call SetFilteredSubspaceSolver() to provide a solver specific
* to the filtered subspace.
* 5. Use Mult() to apply the solver.
