/**
* @class FilteredSolver
* @brief Base class for solvers with filtering (subspace correction).
*
* FilteredSolver is designed to augment an existing solver with an additional
* filtering step that targets small subspaces where the solver is less
* effective. The filtered subspace is defined by a transfer operator @p P,
* which maps the subspace into the full space.
*
* ### Typical usage
* 1. Call SetOperator() to define the operator @p A that acts on the full space.
* 2. Call SetSolver() to provide the underlying solver @p B for the full-space operator.
* 3. Call SetFilteredSubspaceTransferOperator() to set transfer operator @p P.
* 4. Call SetFilteredSubspaceSolver() to set the subspace solver @p S.
* 5. Use Mult() to apply the solver.
*
* ---
*
* The preconditioner applied by Mult() with the default Mode::MULTIPLICATIVE
* is
*  $$
* M = B + P S P^T (I - A B) + B (I - A P S P^T) (I- A B),
*  $$
* and the corresponding iteration matrix is
*  $$
* I - M A = (I - B A) (I - P S P^T A) (I - B A).
*  $$
*
* Two other combination modes are available via SetMode(): Mode::REVERSED
* applies the same three-stage combination with the roles of @p B and the
* subspace correction $ P S P^T $ swapped, and Mode::ADDITIVE applies a
* single application of each, summed, i.e. $ M = B + P S P^T $.

   * @brief Order in which the base solver @a B and the subspace correction
   * $ P S P^T $ are combined in Mult().
   *
   * - MULTIPLICATIVE (default): B, then the subspace correction, then B
   *   again, each stage using the residual updated by the previous one. This
   *   is the scheme documented in the class-level formula above.
   * - REVERSED: the same three-stage multiplicative combination, but with
   *   the roles of @a B and the subspace correction swapped, i.e. subspace
   *   correction, then B, then subspace correction again.
   * - ADDITIVE: a single application of @a B and a single application of
   *   the subspace correction, both using the original residual and summed,
   *   i.e. $ M = B + P S P^T $, with no intermediate residual update.

   * @brief Automatically build a filtered subspace transfer operator from
   * the row magnitudes of the system operator previously set via
   * SetOperator().
   *
   * This heuristic targets systems where a small number of rows have an L1
   * norm that is much larger than the rest, such as the penalty or
   * Lagrange-multiplier rows that appear in the interior-point formulation
   * used for frictionless contact. The procedure is:
   *  1. Compute the L1 norm of every row of the system operator (collected
   *     across all MPI ranks, since the operator is distributed).
   *  2. Fit a two-component 1D Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to the row
   *     norms using Expectation-Maximization; every step is computed in
   *     parallel across ranks (no row norm data is gathered to one rank).
   *  3. If the mean of the larger-norm cluster is more than @a
   *     jump_threshold times the mean of the smaller-norm cluster, build
   *     and install (via SetFilteredSubspaceTransferOperator()) a transfer
   *     operator whose subspace is the set of rows assigned to the
   *     larger-norm cluster.
   *  4. Otherwise, no clear separation was found: filtering is disabled,
   *     and Mult() falls back to a single application of the base AMG
   *     solver until this function is called again.
   *
   * This method is collective over the communicator of the operator, and
   * SetOperator() must have been called first. The operator is not owned and
   * must remain valid while this object uses it.
   *
   * The generated transfer operator is owned by this object and replaces any
   * transfer operator set previously via SetFilteredSubspaceTransferOperator().
   * Since the subspace size is not known in advance, the subspace solver must
   * be able to handle it: if a solver factory was given to
   * EnableAutoFilteredSubspace(), a new subspace solver is built and installed
   * whenever the subspace size changes; otherwise the solver set via
   * SetFilteredSubspaceSolver() is kept, and it is the caller's
   * responsibility that it supports the new subspace operator.
   *
   * See the `-amgf-auto-subspace` option of the contact miniapp
   * (miniapps/contact/contact.cpp) for an example of use.
   *
   * @param max_iter Maximum number of EM iterations for the GMM fit.
   * @param tol Relative tolerance on the change of the two cluster means,
   *            used as the EM convergence criterion.
   * @param jump_threshold The larger-norm cluster is used as the filtered
   *                        subspace only if its mean exceeds this many
   *                        times the smaller-norm cluster's mean.
   * @return true if a filtered subspace was generated and installed; false
   *         if filtering was disabled because no sufficient separation was
   *         found between the two clusters.

   * @brief Enable or disable automatic filtered subspace generation.
   *
   * When enabled, every call to SetOperator() automatically calls
   * GenerateFilteredSubspaceTransferOperator() with the given parameters on
   * the newly installed operator, instead of requiring the caller to invoke
   * it manually. This is useful when AMGFSolver is driven indirectly, e.g.
   * as the preconditioner of an IterativeSolver whose SetOperator() cascades
   * to the preconditioner's SetOperator() on every linear solve (such as
   * every Newton iteration of an interior-point optimizer): the filtered
   * subspace is then automatically refreshed from the current operator each
   * time, with no other code changes required.
   *
   * Because the size of an automatically-generated subspace can change
   * every time it is regenerated, a fixed subspace solver (as set by
   * SetFilteredSubspaceSolver()) generally cannot be reused across calls:
   * most direct solvers assume a fixed operator size for their lifetime.
   * Instead, @a solver_factory is called to build a fresh subspace solver
   * whenever the subspace width changes; AMGFSolver owns the resulting
   * solver and destroys it when it is replaced or when *this is destroyed.
   *
   * While automatic generation is enabled, every SetOperator() call replaces
   * the transfer operator and, when the subspace size changes, the subspace
   * solver, so a transfer operator or subspace solver set manually via
   * SetFilteredSubspaceTransferOperator() or SetFilteredSubspaceSolver() is
   * overwritten.
   *
   * See the `-amgf-auto-subspace` option of the contact miniapp
   * (miniapps/contact/contact.cpp) for an example of use.
   *
   * @param enable Turn automatic generation on or off.
   * @param solver_factory Builds a new solver for the filtered subspace
   *        operator; called on the first use and again whenever the
   *        subspace width changes. Required if @a enable is true.
   * @param max_iter,tol,jump_threshold Forwarded to
   *        GenerateFilteredSubspaceTransferOperator() on every SetOperator()
   *        call.
