       Assuming square operator, form the operator linear system `A(X)=B`,
       corresponding to it and the right-hand side @a b, by applying any
       necessary transformations such as: parallel assembly, conforming
       constraints for non-conforming AMR and eliminating boundary conditions.
       @note Static condensation and hybridization are not supported for general
       operators (cf. the analogous methods BilinearForm::FormLinearSystem() and
       ParBilinearForm::FormLinearSystem()).

       The constraints are specified through the prolongation P from
       GetProlongation(), and restriction R from GetRestriction() methods, which
       are e.g. available through the (parallel) finite element space of any
       (parallel) bilinear form operator. We assume that the operator is square,
       using the same input and output space, so we have: `A(X)=[P^t (*this)
       P](X)`, `B=P^t(b)`, and `x=P(X)`.

       The vector @a x must contain the essential boundary condition values.
       These are eliminated through the ConstrainedOperator class and the vector
       @a X is initialized by setting its essential entries to the boundary
       conditions and all other entries to zero (@a copy_interior == 0) or
       copied from @a x (@a copy_interior != 0).

       After solving the system `A(X)=B`, the (finite element) solution @a x can
       be recovered by calling Operator::RecoverFEMSolution() with the same
       vectors @a X, @a b, and @a x.

       @note The caller is responsible for destroying the output operator @a A!
       @note If there are no transformations, @a X simply reuses the data of @a
       x. */
