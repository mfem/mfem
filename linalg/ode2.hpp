       @param[in,out] dxdt Approximate rate.
       @param[in,out] t    Time associated with the approximate solution @a x.
       @param[in,out] dt   Time step size.

       The following rules describe the common behavior of the method:
       - The input @a x [in] is the approximate solution for the input time
         @a t [in].
       - The input @a dxdt [in] is the approximate rate for the input time
         @a t [in].
       - The input @a dt [in] is the desired time step size, defining the desired
         target time: t [target] = @a t [in] + @a dt [in].
       - The output @a x [out] is the approximate solution for the output time
         @a t [out].
       - The output @a dxdt [out] is the approximate rate for the output time
         @a t [out].
       - The output @a dt [out] is the last time step taken by the method which
         may be smaller or larger than the input @a dt [in] value, e.g. because
         of time step control.
       - The method may perform more than one time step internally; in this case
         @a dt [out] is the last internal time step size.
       - The output value of @a t [out] may be smaller or larger than
         t [target], however, it is not smaller than @a t [in] + @a dt [out], if
         at least one internal time step was performed.
       - The values @a x [out] and @a dxdt [out] may be obtained by interpolation
         using internally stored data.
       - In some cases, the contents of @a x [in] or @a dxdt [in] may not be used,
         e.g. when @a x [out] or @a dxdt [out] from a previous Step() call was
         obtained by interpolation.
       - In consecutive calls to this method, the output @a t [out] of one
         Step() call has to be the same as the input @a t [in] to the next
         Step() call.
       - If the previous rule has to be broken, e.g. to restart a time stepping
         sequence, then the ODE solver must be re-initialized by calling Init()
         between the two Step() calls. */

       The default implementation makes consecutive calls to Step() until
       reaching @a tf.
       The following rules describe the common behavior of the method:
       - The input @a x [in] is the approximate solution for the input time
