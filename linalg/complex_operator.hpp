/** @brief Mimic the action of a complex operator using two real operators.

    This operator requires vectors that are twice the length of its internally
    stored real operators, Op_Real and Op_Imag. It is assumed that these vectors
    store the real part of the vector first followed by its imaginary part.

    ComplexOperator allows one to choose a convention upon construction, which
    facilitates symmetry.

    If we let (y_r + i y_i) = (Op_r + i Op_i)(x_r + i x_i) then Matrix-vector
    products are computed as:

    1. When Convention::HERMITIAN is used (default)
    / y_r \   / Op_r -Op_i \ / x_r \
    |     | = |            | |     |
    \ y_i /   \ Op_i  Op_r / \ x_i /

    2. When Convention::BLOCK_SYMMETRIC is used
    / y_r \   / Op_r -Op_i \ / x_r \
    |     | = |            | |     |
    \-y_i /   \-Op_i -Op_r / \ x_i /
    In other words, Matrix-vector products with Convention::BLOCK_SYMMETRIC
    compute the complex conjugate of Op*x.

    Either convention can be used with a given complex operator, however, each
    of them may be best suited for different classes of problems. For example:

    1. Convention::HERMITIAN, is well suited for Hermitian operators, i.e.,
       operators where the real part is symmetric and the imaginary part of the
       operator is anti-symmetric, hence the name. In such cases the resulting 2
       x 2 operator will be symmetric.

    2. Convention::BLOCK_SYMMETRIC, is well suited for operators where both the
       real and imaginary parts are symmetric. In this case the resulting 2 x 2
       operator will also be symmetric. Such operators are common when studying
       damped oscillations, for example.

    Note: this class cannot be used to represent a general nonlinear complex
    operator.
