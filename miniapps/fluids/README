# Incompressible Schrödinger Flow

This miniapp introduces incompressible Schrödinger flow (ISF), a ℂ²-valued
Schrödinger equation that incorporates an incompressibility constraint to
model classical incompressible fluids. Drawing from Madelung's quantum
hydrodynamics, this approach provides straightforward implementation
and exhibits strong performance in capturing thin vortex behaviors.
