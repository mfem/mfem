   $0 [-h|-help] {mfem_dir}

   where: {mfem_dir}  is the MFEM source directory [default value: ../..]
          -h|-help    prints this usage information and exits

   This script checks if the code in mfem_dir conforms to the MFEM C++ style
   (currently based on astyle-2.05.1). Note that the comparison is done with
   "git diff", so all differences between mfem_dir and the repository will be
   reported. The local changes can be erased (lost!) with "git checkout .".

   In addition to C++ styling, the script also verifies that std::cout and
   std::cerr are not used in the library (use mfem::out and mfem::err instead).

   Example usage: $0 ../..
