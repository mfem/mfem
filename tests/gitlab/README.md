FIXME: this file needs to be updated

This directory contains utility scripts related to GitLab testing at LLNL.

* `build_and_test_setup` is used in CI to setup certain directories before
  running the tests.

   This script was designed to be used in CI context. It is easier for the sake
   of reproducibility to clone MFEM `data` and `autotest` repository manually
   next to your MFEM repository, _unless you are using the inline reproducer
   provided in CI, in which case the required variables will be set for you._

* `build_and_test` is used in CI to build TPLs (dependencies) and MFEM and to
  perform testing.

   While designed to be used in CI context, this script can also be used
   standalone on LLNL's LC in order to reproduce a similar build.
   Please refer to tests/gitlab/reproduce-ci-jobs-interactively.md for details.

* `get_mfem_uberenv` sets uberenv up for use with MFEM, notably to install TPLs
  with Spack.

  Uberenv, configured for MFEM, is maintained in a separate repo. This script
  downloads and places it in `tests/uberenv`. The exact commit to extract is
  hard-coded.

* `generate_spack_upstream` can be used to generate a Spack upstream instance.

  This script addresses a much less common use case, where the TPLs for any
  MFEM target appearing in CI are built in Spack instance using Uberenv.
  Configuring permissions accordingly allows this instance to be reused to
  prevent multiple installations. Such an upstream instance can be found on LC
  in `/usr/workspace/mfem/spack-upstream`.
