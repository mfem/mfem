The only prerequisite for building MFEM is a (modern) C++ compiler, such as
g++. Some of the dense linear algebra functionality in MFEM requires the LAPACK
and BLAS libraries from http://www.netlib.org/lapack. If LAPACK is not provided,
the corresponding MFEM functions will either use a simple internal version, or
generate run-time errors when used.

Three build systems are supported, based on make, GNU make (gmake) and SCons, as
described below.


Building with 'make'
====================
MFEM comes with a standard makefile which can be modified as needed, e.g. to
enable the use of LAPACK and specify its location. The makefile also generates
the "mfem_defs.hpp" header file which lists all "define" symbols from the build.

Some of the available 'make' targets are:

make       -> Builds the libmfem.a library
make debug -> Builds a debug version
make clean -> Cleans the build


Building with 'gmake'
=====================
MFEM also comes with a GNUmakefile for GNU make (gmake) which follows closely
the makefile and provides some additional functionality. On many Linux systems
the installed copy of make is actually a version of gmake; in this case the
GNUmakefile will be used instead of the makefile.

Some of the available 'gmake' targets are:

gmake       -> Builds the libmfem.a library
gmake debug -> Builds a debug version
gmake clean -> Cleans the build


Building with 'SCons'
====================
SCons is a Python-based next generation build system from http://www.scons.org/,
which combines the capabilities of make and configure. The included SConstruct
file will automatically detect the availability of LAPACK.

Some of the available 'SCons' targets are:

scons         -> Builds the libmfem.a library
scons debug=1 -> Builds a debug version
scons -c      -> Cleans the build
