# This workflow is run on pushes to any branch in the MFEM repo (with or without
# PRs), as well as on updates to PRs from forks. In particular, we do not
# duplicate work by running on both pushes and updates to local PRs. We do that
# by checking if the workflow trigger is 'push' ("github.event_name == 'push'")
# and if we are in a fork ("github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name !=
# github.repository").
