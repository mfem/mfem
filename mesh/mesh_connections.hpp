   /** @brief Returns the neighbor entity indices of the given @a entities.  The @a neighbors
       struct operates as an in/out parameter.  The kind of the neighbor entities is set in the
       @a neighbors.dim and @a neighbors.index_type members.  The neighbor
       entity index numbers are placed in @a neighbors.ids member.  The @a shared_dim parameter
       sets the dimension of the entities that the neighbors are sharing across.  For example if the
       entity/neighbor dims are 0 and the shared_dim is 0 this will return the vertex that are
       neighbors across the edges connected to the vertex entity.  Note:  The entities.dim and
       neighbors.dim must be the same.  Also, none of the index numbers from the @a entities set
       will be returned in the @a neighbors set, even if they are neighbors of others in the
       @a entities set.  For the example mesh with vertex, edge, face/element, and
       boundary element Indices we have:

        0,All          1,All          2,All          1,Bdr
