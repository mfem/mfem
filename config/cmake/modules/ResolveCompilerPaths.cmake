# ResolveCompilerPaths - this module defines two macros
#
# RESOLVE_LIBRARIES (XXX_LIBRARIES LINK_LINE)
#  This macro is intended to be used by FindXXX.cmake modules.
#  It parses a compiler link line and resolves all libraries
#  (-lfoo) using the library path contexts (-L/path) in scope.
#  The result in XXX_LIBRARIES is the list of fully resolved libs.
#  Example:
#
#    RESOLVE_LIBRARIES (FOO_LIBRARIES "-L/A -la -L/B -lb -lc -ld")
#
#  will be resolved to
#
#    FOO_LIBRARIES:STRING="/A/liba.so;/B/libb.so;/A/libc.so;/usr/lib/libd.so"
#
#  if the filesystem looks like
#
#    /A:       liba.so         libc.so
#    /B:       liba.so libb.so
#    /usr/lib: liba.so libb.so libc.so libd.so
#
#  and /usr/lib is a system directory.
#
#  Note: If RESOLVE_LIBRARIES() resolves a link line differently from
#  the native linker, there is a bug in this macro (please report it).
#
# RESOLVE_INCLUDES (XXX_INCLUDES INCLUDE_LINE)
#  This macro is intended to be used by FindXXX.cmake modules.
#  It parses a compile line and resolves all includes
#  (-I/path/to/include) to a list of directories.  Other flags are ignored.
#  Example:
#
#    RESOLVE_INCLUDES (FOO_INCLUDES "-I/A -DBAR='\"irrelevant -I/string here\"' -I/B")
#
#  will be resolved to
#
#    FOO_INCLUDES:STRING="/A;/B"
#
#  assuming both directories exist.
#  Note: as currently implemented, the -I/string will be picked up mistakenly (cry, cry)
