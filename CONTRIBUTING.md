### Code Overview

#### Source code structure:

The MFEM library uses object-oriented design principles which reflect, in code,
the independent mathematical concepts of meshing, linear algebra and finite
element spaces and operators.

The MFEM source code has the following structure:

```
  .
  ├── config
  │   └── cmake
  │       └── modules
  ├── data
  ├── doc
  │   └── web
  │       └── examples
  ├── examples
  │   ├── ginkgo
  │   ├── hiop
  │   ├── petsc
  │   ├── pumi
  │   └── sundials
  ├── fem
  │   └── libceed
  ├── general
  ├── linalg
  ├── mesh
  ├── miniapps
  │   ├── common
  │   ├── electromagnetics
  │   ├── gslib
  │   ├── meshing
  │   ├── nurbs
  │   ├── performance

  │   └── toys
  └── tests
      ├── scripts
      ├── unit
      │   ├── ...
      └── ...
```

#### Main directories and classes

The main directories are `fem/`, `mesh/` and `linalg/` containing the C++
classes implementing the finite element, mesh and linear algebra concepts
respectively.

- The main mesh classes are:
  + [`Mesh`](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/classmfem_1_1Mesh.html)
  + [`NCMesh`](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/classmfem_1_1NCMesh.html)
  + [`Element`](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/classmfem_1_1Element.html)
  + [`ElementTransformation`](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/classmfem_1_1ElementTransformation.html)

- The main finite element classes are:
  + [`FiniteElement`](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/classmfem_1_1FiniteElement.html)
  + [`FiniteElementCollection`](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/classmfem_1_1FiniteElement.html)
  + [`FiniteElementSpace`](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/classmfem_1_1FiniteElementSpace.html)
  + [`GridFunction`](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/classmfem_1_1GridFunction.html)
  + [`BilinearFormIntegrator`](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/classmfem_1_1BilinearFormIntegrator.html) and [`LinearFormIntegrator`](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/classmfem_1_1LinearFormIntegrator.html)
  + [`LinearForm`](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/classmfem_1_1LinearFormIntegrator.html), [`BilinearForm`](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/classmfem_1_1BilinearForm.html) and [`MixedBilinearForm`](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/classmfem_1_1MixedBilinearForm.html)

- The main linear algebra classes and sources are
  + [`Operator`](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/classmfem_1_1Operator.html) and [`BilinearForm`](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/classmfem_1_1BilinearForm.html)
  + [`Vector`](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/classmfem_1_1BilinearForm.html) and [`LinearForm`](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/classmfem_1_1LinearForm.html)
  + [`DenseMatrix`](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/classmfem_1_1DenseMatrix.html) and [`SparseMatrix`](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/classmfem_1_1SparseMatrix.html)
  + Sparse [smoothers](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/sparsesmoothers_8hpp.html) and linear [solvers](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/solvers_8hpp.html)

#### Parallel implementation

Parallel MPI objects in MFEM inherit their serial counterparts, so a parallel
mesh for example is just a serial mesh on each task plus the information on
shared geometric entities between different tasks. The parallel source files
have a `p` prefix, e.g. `pmesh.cpp` vs. the serial `mesh.cpp`.

- The main parallel classes are
  + [`ParMesh`](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/solvers_8hpp.html)
  + [`ParNCMesh`](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/classmfem_1_1ParMesh.html)
  + [`ParFiniteElementSpace`](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/classmfem_1_1ParFiniteElementSpace.html)
  + [`ParGridFunction`](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/classmfem_1_1ParGridFunction.html)
  + [`ParBilinearForm`](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/classmfem_1_1ParBilinearForm.html) and [`ParLinearForm`](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/classmfem_1_1ParLinearForm.html)
  + [`HypreParMatrix`](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/classmfem_1_1HypreParMatrix.html) and [`HypreParVector`](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/classmfem_1_1HypreParVector.html)
  + [`HypreSolver`](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/classmfem_1_1HypreSolver.html) and other [hypre classes](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/hypre_8hpp.html)

#### GPU and general device support

GPU and multi-core CPU support is based on device kernels supporting different
backends (CUDA, OCCA, RAJA, OpenMP, etc.) and an internal lightweight
device/host memory manager.

- The main device-relevant classes and sources are:
  + [`Device`](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/device_8hpp.html)
  + [`MemoryManager`](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/mem_manager_8hpp.html)
  + the [`MFEM_FORALL`](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/forall_8hpp.html) macro
  + the [`cuda.hpp`](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/cuda_8hpp.html) and [`occa.hpp`](http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/occa_8hpp.html) files

#### Utilities, building and documentation
- The `general/` directory contains C++ classes that serve as utilities for
  communication, error handling, arrays, (Boolean) tables, timing, etc.
- The `config/` directory contains build-related files, both for the plain
  Makefile and the CMake build options.
- The `doc/` directory contains configuration for the Doxygen code documentation
  that can either be built locally or browsed online at
  http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/index.html.

#### Examples and tests
- `examples` and `miniapps` respectively gather simple and more fully-featured
  demonstrations of the usage on MFEM. They both rely on `data/` for the
  collection of meshes.
- The `tests/` directory contains a unit test suite and will later contain more
  tests that run example codes.

See also the [code overview](http://mfem.org/code-overview/) section on the MFEM
website.

## GitHub Workflow

The MFEM GitHub organization: https://github.com/mfem, is the main developer hub
for the MFEM project.

If you plan to make contributions or would like to stay up-to-date with changes
in the code, *we strongly encourage you to [join the MFEM organization](#mfem-organization)*.

This will simplify the workflow (by providing you additional permissions), and
will allow us to reach you directly with project announcements.


### MFEM Organization

#### Getting started (GitHub)
Before you can start, you need a GitHub account, here are a few suggestions:
  + Create the account at: [github.com/join](https://github.com/join).
  + For easy identification, please add your full name and maybe a picture of you at:
    https://github.com/settings/profile.
  + To receive notification, set a primary email at: https://github.com/settings/emails.
  + For password-less pull/push over SSH, add your SSH keys at: https://github.com/settings/keys.

#### Joining
- [Contact us](#contact-information) for an invitation to join the MFEM GitHub
  organization. You will receive an invitation email, which you can directly accept.
  Alternatively, *after logging into GitHub*, you can accept the invitation at
  the top of https://github.com/mfem.
- Consider making your membership public by going to https://github.com/orgs/mfem/people
  and clicking on the organization visibility drop box next to your name.
- Project discussions and announcements will be posted at
  https://github.com/orgs/mfem/teams/everyone.

#### Structure
- The MFEM source code is in the [mfem](https://github.com/mfem/mfem)
  repository.
- The website and corresponding documentation are in the
  [web](https://github.com/mfem/web) repository.
- The [PyMFEM](https://github.com/mfem/PyMFEM) repository contains a Python
  wrapper for MFEM.
- The [data](https://github.com/mfem/data) repository contains additional
  (large) datafiles for MFEM.


### New Feature Development

- A new feature should be important enough that at least one person, the
  author, is willing to work on it and be its champion.

- The author creates a branch for the new feature (with suffix `-dev`), off
  the `master` branch, or another existing feature branch, for example:

  ```
  # Clone assuming you have setup your ssh keys on GitHub:
  git clone git@github.com:mfem/mfem.git

  # Alternatively, clone using the "https" protocol:
  git clone https://github.com/mfem/mfem.git

  # Create a new feature branch starting from "master":
  git checkout master
  git pull
  git checkout -b feature-dev

  # Work on "feature-dev", add local commits
  # ...

  # (One time only) push the branch to github and setup your local
  # branch to track the github branch (for "git pull"):
  git push -u origin feature-dev

  ```

- **We prefer that you create the new feature branch inside the MFEM organization
  as opposed to in a fork.** This allows everyone in the community to collaborate
  in one central place.

  - If you prefer to work in your fork, please [enable upstream edits](https://help.github.com/articles/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork/).

  - Never use the `next` branch to start a new feature branch!

- The typical feature branch name is `new-feature-dev`, e.g. `pumi-dev`. While
  not frequent in MFEM, other suffixes are possible, e.g. `-fix`, `-doc`, etc.


### Developer Guidelines

- *Keep the code lean and as simple as possible*
  - Well-designed simple code is frequently more general and powerful.
  - Lean code base is easier to understand by new collaborators.
  - New features should be added only if they are necessary or generally useful.
  - Introduction of language constructions not currently used in MFEM should be
    justified and generally avoided (to maintain portability to various systems
    and compilers, including early access hardware).
  - We prefer basic C++ and the C++03 standard, to keep the code readable by
    a large audience and to make sure it compiles anywhere.

- *Keep the code general and reasonably efficient*
  - The main goal is fast prototyping for research and application development.
  - When in doubt, generality wins over efficiency.
  - Respect the needs of different users (current and/or future).

- *Keep things separate and logically organized*
  - General usage features go in MFEM (implemented in as much generality as
    possible), non-general features go into external apps.
  - Inside MFEM, compartmentalize between linalg, fem, mesh, GLVis, etc.
  - Contributions that are project-specific or have external dependencies are
    allowed (if they are of broader interest), but should be `#ifdef`-ed and not
    change the code by default.

- Code specifics
  - All significant new classes, methods and functions have Doxygen-style
    documentation in source comments.
  - Consistent code styling is enforced with `make style` in the top-level
    directory. This requires [Artistic Style](http://astyle.sourceforge.net) (we
    specifically use version 2.05.1). See also the file `config/mfem.astylerc`.
  - Use `mfem::out` and `mfem::err` instead of `std::cout` and `std::cerr` in
    internal library code. (You can use `std` in examples and miniapps.)
  - When manually resolving conflicts during a merge, make sure to mention the
    conflicted files in the commit message.

### Pull Requests

- When your branch is ready for other developers to review / comment on
  the code, create a pull request towards `mfem:master`.

- Pull request typically have titles like:

     `Description [new-feature-dev]`

  for example:

     `Parallel Unstructured Mesh Infrastructure (PUMI) integration [pumi-dev]`

  Note the branch name suffix (in square brackets).

- Titles may contain a prefix in square brackets to emphasize the type of PR.
  Common choices are: `[DON'T MERGE]`, `[WIP]` and `[DISCUSS]`, for example:

     `[DISCUSS] Hybridized DG [hdg-dev]`

- If the PR is still a work in progress, add the `WIP` label to it and
  optionally the `[WIP]` prefix in the title.

- Add a description, appropriate labels and assign yourself to the PR. The MFEM
  team will add reviewers as appropriate.

- List outstanding TODO items in the description, see PR #222 for an example.

- When your contribution is fully working and ready to be reviewed, add
  the `ready-for-review` label.

- PRs are treated similarly to journal submission with an "editor" assigning
  two reviewers to evaluate the changes. The reviewers have 3 weeks to evaluate
  the PR and work with the author to implement improvements and fix issues.

- After approval, the PR is [tested](#masternext-workflow) for a week with
  other approved PRs in the `mfem:next` branch.

- Consider manually running the tests in `tests/scripts` before merging in
  `mfem:next`, see the [README](tests/scripts/README) file in that directory
  for more details.

- Track the Travis CI and Appveyor [continuous integration](#automated-testing)
  builds at the end of the PR. These should generally run clean, so address any
  errors as soon as possible. Please ask if you are unsure how to do that.

- Note that some tests, such as the `branch-history` check in Travis are
  safeguards that are allowed to fail in certain cases.

- Other tests, such as the `code-style`, `documentation` and `gitignore`
  checks in Travis enforce MFEM-specific rules which are explained in the
  error messages and the `tests/scripts` directory.

### Master/Next Workflow

MFEM uses a `master`/`next`-branch workflow as described below:

- The `master` branch should always be of release quality and changes should not
  be merged until they have been fully tested. This branch is protected, and
  changes can only be made through pull requests.

- After approval, a pull request is merged manually (by MFEM developers) in the
  `next` branch for testing and the `in-next` label is added to the PR.
  This can be done as follows:

  ```
  # Pull the latest version of the "feature-dev" branch
  git checkout feature-dev
  git pull

  # Pull the latest version of the "next" branch
  git checkout next
  git pull

  # Merge "feature-dev" into "next", resolving conflicts, if necessary.
  # Use the "--no-ff" flag to create a new commit with merge message.
  git merge --no-ff feature-dev

  # Push the "next" branch to the server
  git push
  ```

- After a week of testing in `next` (excluding bugfixes), both on GitHub, as
  well as [internally](#tests-at-llnl) at LLNL, the original PR is merged into
  `master` (provided there are no issues).

- After the merge, the feature branch is deleted (unless it is a long-term
  project with periodic PRs).

- The `next` branch is used just for integrated testing of all PRs approved for
  merging into `master` to verify that each works individually and that all of
  them work as a group. This branch can be discarded at any time, though we
  typically do that only at the end of a [release cycle](#releases).


### Releases

- Releases are just tags in the `master` branch, e.g. https://github.com/mfem/mfem/releases/tag/v3.3.2,
  and have a version that ends in an even "patch" number, e.g. `v3.2.2` or
  `v3.4` (by convention `v3.4` is the same as `v3.4.0`.)  Between releases, the
  version ends in an odd "patch" number, e.g. `v3.3.3`.

- We use [milestones](https://github.com/mfem/mfem/milestones) to coordinate the
  work on different PRs toward a release, see for example the
  [v3.3.2 release](https://github.com/mfem/mfem/milestone/1?closed=1).

- After a release is complete, the `next` branch is recreated, e.g. as follows
  (replace `3.3.2` with current release):
  - Rename the current `next` branch to `next-pre-v3.3.2`.
  - Create a new `next` branch starting from the `v3.3.2` release.
  - Local copies of `next` can then be updated with `git fetch origin next && git checkout -B next origin/next`.

### Release Checklist

- [ ] Update the MFEM version in the following files:
    - [ ] `CHANGELOG`
    - [ ] `makefile`
    - [ ] `CMakeLists.txt`
    - [ ] `doc/CodeDocumentation.conf.in`
- [ ] (LLNL only) Make sure all `README.html` files in the source repo are up to date.
- [ ] Tag the repository:

  ```
  git tag -a v3.1 -m "Official release v3.1"
  git push origin v3.1
  ```
- [ ] Create the release tarball and push to `mfem/releases`.
- [ ] Recreate the `next` branch as described in previous section.
- [ ] Update and push documentation  to `mfem/doxygen`.
- [ ] Update URL shortlinks:
    - [ ] Create a shortlink at [http://bit.ly/](http://bit.ly/) for the release tarball, e.g. http://mfem.github.io/releases/mfem-3.1.tgz.
    - [ ] (LLNL only) Add and commit the new shortlink in the `links` and `links-mfem` files of the internal `mfem/downloads` repo.
    - [ ] Add the new shortlinks to the MFEM packages in `spack`, `homebrew/science`, `VisIt`, etc.
- [ ] Update website in `mfem/web` repo:
    - Update version and shortlinks in `src/index.md` and `src/download.md`.
    -  Use [cloc-1.62.pl](http://cloc.sourceforge.net/) and `ls -lh` to estimate the SLOC and the tarball size in `src/download.md`.


## LLNL Workflow

### Mirroring on Bitbucket

- The GitHub `master` and `next` branches are mirrored to the LLNL institutional
  Bitbucket repository as `gh-master` and `gh-next`.

- `gh-master` is merged into LLNL's internal `master` through pull requests; write
  permissions to `master` are restricted to ensure this is the only way in which it
  gets updated.

- We never push directly from LLNL to GitHub.

- Versions of the code on LLNL's internal server, from most to least stable:
  - MFEM official release on mfem.org -- Most stable, tested in many apps.
  - `mfem:master` -- Recent development version, guaranteed to work.
  - `mfem:gh-master` -- Stable development version, passed testing, you can use
     it to build your code between releases.
  - `mfem:gh-next` -- Bleeding-edge development version, may be broken, use at
     your own risk.

## Automated Testing

MFEM has several levels of automated testing running on GitHub, as well as on
local Mac and Linux workstations, and Livermore Computing clusters at LLNL.

### Linux and Mac smoke tests
We use Travis CI to drive the default tests on the `master` and `next`
branches. See the `.travis` file and the logs at
[https://travis-ci.org/mfem/mfem](https://travis-ci.org/mfem/mfem).

Testing using Travis CI should be kept lightweight, as there is a 50 minute time
constraint on jobs. Two virtual machines are configured - Mac (OS X) and Linux.

- Tests on the `master` branch are triggered whenever a PR is issued on this branch.
- Tests on the `next` branch are currently scheduled to run each night.

### Windows smoke test
We use Appveyor to test building with the MS Visual C++ compiler in a Windows
environment, as well as to test the CMake build. See the `.appveyor` file and the
build logs at
[https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mfem/mfem](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mfem/mfem).

CMake is used to generate the MSVC Project files and drive the build.  A release
and debug build is performed with a simple run of `ex1` to verify the executable.

### Tests at LLNL

- We mirror the `master` and `next` branches internally (to `gh-master`
and `gh-next`) and run longer nightly tests via cron. On the weekends, a more
extensive test is run which extracts and executes all the different sample runs
from each example.
