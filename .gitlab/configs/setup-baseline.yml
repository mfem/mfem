# The setup_baseline job doesn't rely on MFEM git repo. It prepares a
# pipeline-wide working directory downloading/updating external repos.
# TODO:
# updating tests and tpls is not necessary anymore since pipelines are now
# using unique directories so repo are never shared with another pipeline. This
# is not memory efficient (we keep a lot of data), hence this reminder.
