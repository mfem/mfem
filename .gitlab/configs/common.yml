# We define the following GitLab pipeline variables:
variables:

# The path to the shared resource between all jobs. For example, external
# repositories like 'tests' and 'tpls' are cloned here. Also, 'tpls' is built
# once for all targets, so that build happen here. The BUILD_ROOT is unique to
# the pipeline, preventing any form of concurrency with other pipelines. This
# also means that the BUILD_ROOT directory will never be cleaned.
# TODO: add a clean-up mechanism
  BUILD_ROOT: ${USER_CI_TOP_DIR}/${CI_PROJECT_NAME}-${MACHINE_NAME}-pipeline-${CI_PIPELINE_ID}

# On LLNL's quartz, there is only one allocation shared among jobs in order to
# save time and resource. This allocation has to be uniquely named so that we
# are sure to retrieve it.
  ALLOC_NAME: ${CI_PROJECT_NAME}_ci_${CI_PIPELINE_ID}
