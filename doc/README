This directory contains Doxygen configuration files for building HTML
documentation of the MFEM sources (including the example codes and miniapps).

If not already available, Doxygen can be downloaded from

   http://www.doxygen.org

We recommend using version 1.8 or later.

To build the documentation, simply type "make" in the doc/ directory. This will
create the file CodeDocumentation.html, which can be viewed in any web browser.

Alternatively, the (pre-build) documentation can be browsed directly online at

   https://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/index.html


Some building considerations:

- To clean the (large) CodeDocumentation/ directory, type "make clean".

- On Mac OS X, the command-line executable "doxygen", required to build the code
  documentation, can be found inside the Doxygen application in

     Doxygen.app/Contents/Resources/doxygen

- The class inheritance and collaboration diagrams in the code documentation use
  the directed graph visualization tool, DOT, which is part of the Graphviz
  package. If not available (e.g. on Mac OS X), Graphviz can be downloaded from

     http://www.graphviz.org

- Formulas in the documentation are rendered using LaTeX. A popular choice for
  TeX typesetting is the TeX Live distribution
